Approaches:
I have designed Rest Assured with Java framework for API testing
JUnit is used for validation and assertion.
Extent Report(Spark) is configured as reporting tool

Framework Structure:

1.Step definition class: all the steps mentions in feature files are defined in this class
2. Utils class: Utility class defined with reusable request and response specifications
3.global.peoperties file: To define global properties and drive all global variables


Improvement To The framework:
1.Building POJO classes for serializing and deserializing json payload
2.Defining Enum class with constants to hold all resources details
3. Implement logging functionality into framework
4.Excel integration
5. Adding methods to read complex Json

Improvement to tests:
1. Adding more tests with validation and assertion and implement required tagging for all test
2.Implement pre and post conditions with hooks
